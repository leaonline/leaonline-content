This application provides a content store for cross-application content within
the lea.online environment.

## Additional native dependencies

This application requires native OS dependencies to handle file conversions 
(via [ImageMagick](www.imagemagick.org)) and TTS synthesis (via `espeak`).

See the [`install_dependencies.sh` script](./install_dependencies.sh) for details.

Note, that these dependencies also need to be installed on the target server by
the MUP (Meteor-Up) deployment config.
